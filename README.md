# BadCrapple

BadCrapple is a truly awful video renderer written in C using GBDK (Game Boy Development Kit). It takes the iconic "Bad Apple" video as an example and renders it in an incredibly inefficient manner.

## Features

- Renders (most of) the "Bad Apple" video, and potentially any other video if you're brave enough, on the Game Boy.
- Utilizes GBDK for Game Boy development.
- It makes you feel better about your own code.

## Motivation

Have you ever wondered what it would be like to watch a video on a Game Boy? No? Well, neither did I, but here we are. BadCrapple is the result of a misguided attempt to push the boundaries of what's possible (or apparently impossible) on the venerable Game Boy hardware.

## Usage

To run BadCrapple, simply load the compiled ROM onto your Game Boy emulator or device. Once loaded, sit back and prepare to witness pixels being tortured beyond recognition.

## Contributing

Feel free to contribute to this project by submitting pull requests. However, please note that quality is not a priority here. I'm aiming for maximum terribleness. If you have ideas for how to make BadCrapple even worse (or slightly less worse), I'd love to hear them.

## Roadmap

While BadCrapple is already quite bad, there's always room for improvement (or degradation, in this case). Here are some potential future enhancements:

- Implement support for even lower resolutions.
- Introduce random glitches for that extra dose of visual discomfort.
- Experiment with alternative rendering techniques, such as interpretive dance.
- Music, I guess?
